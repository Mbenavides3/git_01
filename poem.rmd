From fairest creatures we desire increase,  
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,  
But as the riper should by time decease,  
His tender heir might bear his memory:  
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,  
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,  
Making a famine where abundance lies,  
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:  
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament, 
And only herald to the gaudy spring,  
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,  

And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding: 
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,  
To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
